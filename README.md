# Emotion-Recognition-using-Deep Learning

In this project, we approach the problem by taking deep-learning method of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which integrates the step of handcrafted feature extraction with training of classifier. This system is able to achieve the relatively most optimal solution through the process of backpropagation.

## Install

This project requires Python 3.2 or higher version and following Python libraries:
*	Keras 1.1.2
*	Scikit Learn 0.18
*	Numpy 1.11.1
*	Pandas 0.18.1
*	Matplotlib 1.5.1
*	Seaborn 0.7.1
*	NLTK 3.2.4

## Datasets
The name of the data set is fer2013 which is an open-source data set that was made publicly available for a Kaggle competition. It contains 48 X 48-pixel grayscale images of the face. There are seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral) present in the data. 
Run

To run the iPython notebook, simply enter:
